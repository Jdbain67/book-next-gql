      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold">Why</h2>
      <p>
        I came across a Sam Selikoff's video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0FUBQPXHMA">Buildng my first Next.js app</a>, and really liked the idea of having a kind of boilerplate CRUD app (in his example, a recipe app) that you might rebuild with different front end stacks. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I think around that time, I had watched a couple sessions from React Europe, one of which covered the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UD98x-2mido">Next.js 9.4 release</a>. In the past, I have used Gatsby, but had yet to look at Next, and so here we are.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-3">Next.js</h2>
      <p>
        Prerendered, static sites have gained momentum in the past 2-3 years, filling a niche and providing improved performance and developer experience for use cases involving, well... static content. Documentation, brochureware, etc, are great candidates for Gatsby or Next, but I think they are increasingly catching on in cases where we might have used a traditional SPA pattern for more interactive experiences without the bloat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Features like <a href="https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-4#incremental-static-regeneration-beta">Incremental Static Regeneration</a> and <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes">Dynamic Routes</a> include the best features of statically rendered sites with the flexibility to generate dynamic content at runtime. 
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-normal mt-2">Deployment / CD </h3>
      <p>
        As this was my first time using Next.js, it was also my first time using the <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> deployment platform. I love using Netlify, so my expectations were high.
      </p> 
      <p>
        It was fairly easy to setup, and now whenever I push to master, my app is built in less than a minute. I also liked that branch deploys were active with zero configuration. Nice! My only question is why my site deploys to (what seems like) a million domains. 
      </p>
      
      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-3">FaunaDB / GraphQL</h2>
      <p>
        I didn't start with Fauna as my backend - I actually started with Hasura. I ran into some problems designing and configuring my database (mostly because I'm not really experienced doing so) and I wasn't quite sure how to setup foreign key relationships in Postgres so that I could access them via GraphQL relations. I've heard good things about Hasura, so I chalk this up my lack of determination ðŸ˜…
      </p>
      <p>
        I hate to say it, but I think I tried <a href="https://fauna.com/">FaunaDB</a> because they had been running a lot of promoted tweets during this time. In any case, Fauna setup "clicked" for me, maybe because you can start with a graphql schema, and once I realized you could create indexes with custom search fields, I felt comfortable setting up what I needed for this app.  
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-3">Tailwind</h2>
      <p>
        This was my first time using <a href="https://tailwind.com">tailwind</a> css, and I like the utility-first concept. Boostrap and Bulma are nice, but I would often supplement those base styles with sass spacing utilities. It can get a little repetitive, but you can always <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/extracting-components/">extract your own components</a>, or add your own styles.
      </p>
      <p>
        I began this project using theme-ui, a css-in-js jsx framework with its own components package. Initially I wasn't a huge fan of css-in-js as I found it hard to read. After a few days I got used to it, and enjoyed the flexibility. I could not get what I wanted out of the theme-ui components, so eventually I scrapped the whole thing, and converted to tailwind.
